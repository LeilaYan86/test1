We're going to look at Instacart data.

```{r}
# Load datasets
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
data(instacart)

instacart = 
  instacart %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
   select(department, reordered, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, order_dow, add_to_cart_order)

```

# Plotly plots
## scatterplot
To investigate if there are certain hours when people tend to place repeat orders sooner (or after a longer period).
```{r}


```

## boxplot


## barplot
